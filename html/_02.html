Explanation of the Code
DOCTYPE and Language Declaration:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html lang="en">: Sets the language of the document to English.
Head Section:

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies that the character encoding is UTF-8, which is widely supported.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures that the page is responsive on different devices by controlling the viewport settings.
<title>Media</title>: The title that appears on the browser tab.
Body Section:

<video height="450" controls>: Creates a video player with a height of 450 pixels. The controls attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, etc.).
<source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">: The src attribute points to the video file. This should be a direct video file URL (e.g., an .mp4 file).
"Your browser does not support the video tag.": A fallback message if the user's browser does not support the HTML5 <video> element.

Key Changes:
Use <iframe> for YouTube:

The src should contain the correct YouTube embed URL: https://www.youtube.com/embed/[video_id].
Replace psj5mIzI9IY with the actual YouTube video ID from your original link.
Height and Width:

Set width and height to match your desired video dimensions, such as width="560" and height="315".
Allow Fullscreen and Controls:

The allow attribute grants permissions for certain features, like autoplay and fullscreen.
Final Notes:
Video Files: Use the <video> tag for actual video files like .mp4 that are hosted on your server.
YouTube: Use <iframe> to embed videos from platforms like YouTube.
