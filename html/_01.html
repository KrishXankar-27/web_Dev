<!-- 
Explanation (Code Focused)
DOCTYPE and Language

<!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
<html lang="en"> declares the language as English.
Head Section

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies that the character encoding is UTF-8, which covers most characters and languages.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page scales correctly on different devices (like mobile phones or tablets).
<title>: The title of the page that shows up on the browser's tab.
Body Styling

style="background-color: #212121; color: aliceblue;": Inline CSS that changes the background color to dark gray and text color to white.
Heading

<h1>: A main heading (level 1) on the page. The content here is just placeholder text.
Form and Label

<form action="url" method="get">: Creates a form.
action="url": Where the form data is sent. Replace "url" with the actual server endpoint.
method="get": The form will send data via the URL. If security is important, use method="post", which hides data from the URL.
Input Field

<input type="text" placeholder="name" id="firstname">: Creates a text input where the user can enter their first name.
placeholder="name": The placeholder text displayed inside the input box.
id="firstname": Connects the input field to the label (for="firstname").
What Else Can Be Used?
For Secure Data Transmission

Use method="post" if sensitive data is being sent. It hides data from being displayed in the URL.
Example: <form action="url" method="post">.
Form Validation

Add required to make the input mandatory.
Example: <input type="text" id="firstname" placeholder="name" required>.
More Input Types

You can use different input types for different data:
Email: <input type="email" placeholder="email">
Password: <input type="password" placeholder="password">
CSS Styles

Instead of using style attributes directly in HTML, use a separate CSS file to keep styles and structure separated.
